# Ruling out the Rulers
This is the codebase for my bachelorproject.
When writing this, I'm a few hours away from deadline, 
so please bear with me if something is not quite right.

The structure of the code is as follows:
 * `build_dynamic_content.py`: This script will build all the figures.
 * `src`: contains the source code for generating the figures
 * `models`: This contains the two pretrained models described in the report. As of now I'm not hosting these anywhere, so contact me if you need them.
 * `build`: This contains all the figures and files generated by other scripts
 * `main.tex`: This is the main file that will be compiled to pdf.
 * `sections`: This contains the different sections of the report - all included through the `main.tex` file.
 * `references.bib`: This contains all references used in the report.

## Make commands
The `Makefile` contains all the commands to compile the report.
 * To compile the report, run `make pdf`.
 * To compile the references, run `make bibliography`.
 * To compile the entire document (including figures and references), run `make fullpdf`.
