\chapter{Conclusion}
The work done in this project shows that a model trained on the HAM10000 
dataset is likely not affected by the fact that rulers are present significantly
more in images of malignant lesions than in images of benign ones.
This statement is checked using experiments used by other researchers in the field
to conclude that their models are using the rulers in its predictions.

The results and discussion shows how difficult it can be to understand what
exactly, deep neural networks are doing.
At the same time it shows why it is crucial to control what information we feed
to our model, as figuring out what parts of it are used is very difficult.

How difficult it was to check if the model was using the rulers in its predictions
also show that researchers have to be cautious when concluding that a model
they have trained is or isn't using some part of the provided information.
