\chapter{Discussion}
Biases on models from confounding elements have been widely reported in machine learning
\cite{DeConstructing_Bias_on_Skin_Lesion_Datasets_2019, Towards_Explainable_Classifiers_Using_the_Counterfactual_Approach_2019, debias-not-so-fast, interps-are-useful}.

The initial goal of this project was to look into methods to not use ruler presence in the
classification of lesions.
To be able to investigate the phenomenon, the plan was to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Train a model that performs fairly well compared to the state of the art \label{item:train-model}
    \item Show that the model is using the presence of ruler in its predictions \label{item:biased-ruler}
    \item Make changes to the model to remove the bias
    \item Rerun the argument as in step \ref{item:biased-ruler} and show that the model is no longer biased
\end{enumerate}
Step \ref{item:train-model} went fairly easy, especially because the dataset is well researched,
so another model could be used for inspiration \cite{kaggle-97-model}.

When reaching step \ref{item:biased-ruler}, the results didn't go quite as expected.
Even though it had been argued in previous papers, that models were doing exactly this
\cite{debias-not-so-fast,interps-are-useful}, I was unable to replicate their results,
to a degree that convinced me that the model was indeed using the rulers.
This changed the focus of the project from removing biased predictions to instead investigating
if there were any biases at all.
In the following, we will go through the experiments made in Section \ref{sec:testing-the-hypothesis} and
examine the results in this light: Do they seem to indicate that the model is using the rulers?

% TODO: Write about the saliency maps - not pointing to the ruler
% Even if they did, its uncertain what they mean (reference to the paper about no hope for XAI)
% And also they are super hard to interpret - they are very prone to introduce confirmation bias
\section{Saliency maps}
In Section \ref{sec:prediction-saliency-map} we investigated the saliency maps of the model predictions.
Previously other researchers had shown that the rulers would be indicated clearly on these maps \cite{interps-are-useful}.
Going through the same experiment with the model trained in this project, we found saliency maps that were
nowhere near as clear as the ones shown in the paper 
(see Figure \ref{fig:interps-are-useful-saliency-maps} and \ref{fig:ruler_saliency_map}).
