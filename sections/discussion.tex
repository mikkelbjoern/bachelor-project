\chapter{Discuission}
Biases on models from confounding elements have been widely reported in machine learning
\cite{DeConstructing_Bias_on_Skin_Lesion_Datasets_2019, Towards_Explainable_Classifiers_Using_the_Counterfactual_Approach_2019, debias-not-so-fast, interps-are-useful}

The initial goal of this project was to look into methods to not use ruler presence in the
classification of lesions.
To be able to investigate the phenomenon, the plan was to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Train a model that performs fairly well compared to the state of the art
    \item Show that the model is biased towards the presence of ruler \label{item:biased-ruler}
          % Write the rest here...
\end{enumerate}
