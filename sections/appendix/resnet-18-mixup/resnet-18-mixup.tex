\chapter{ResNet18 architecture trained with MixUp}\label{appendix:resnet-18-mixup}
This is very heavily inspired by the competetion Kaggle competetion submission by Leon Blume \cite{kaggle-97-model}.

The training was done on DTU high performance computing cluster\cite{dtu-hpc}.
Here a GPU was used, specifically the Tesla V100 16 GB.
