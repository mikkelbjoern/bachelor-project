This project is written as my thesis for my bachelor's degree in Mathemathics and Technology at
the Danish Technical University.
It has been written at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science and supervised by
Professor Aasa Feragen and PhD-student Manxi Lin. 

I would like to acknowledge and give my warmest thanks both of them for all of their help and support.
Their quick and insightful feedback along the way got me through the research process and the writing of this report.

\begin{abstract}
Deep learning models can be used to classify medical images.
This may be problematic, as models reportedly use confounding elements (elements
 in the images that are not supposed to be used in the classification),
in their predictions.
Multiple studies have been conducted to understand, demonstrate and
mitigate the effects of these elements.

This project investigates the impact of one example,
namely, rulers in images of skin lesions originally used by 
doctors to monitor lesion growth.
A close to state-of-the-art classification model is trained, and
using methods of other researchers as well as other methods,
it is concluded, that the model is not using these rulers.
Further, it is argued that other models trained on the same data,
are also unlikely to use the rulers in their predictions.
It is also seen that in general models trained with access to less
information around the lesions perform better, suggesting that
the confounding elements contained there are not necessary
for the models predictions.
Based on the difficulty of the research, it is recommended that
care is taken when making claims about the impact of a confounding 
element on a given model.
